# D3 survival curve

Original data and script (`/original/km_d3.js`) are taken from Live Cancer Explorer by UTSouthwestern Metical Center: https://qbrc.swmed.edu/projects/liverspore/multi_group_survival.php.

The refactored script (`/refactored/drawSurvivalCurve.js`) uses a more recent d3 version (`v5`) and seeks to improve code organization and readability.
